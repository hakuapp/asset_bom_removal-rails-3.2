# Asset::Bom::Removal::Rails

This gem hooks into [Rails `assets:precompile` task](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#precompiling-assets) and removes the BOM from any CSS files (and their gzipped versions) in the asset root.

We do this because we want to use [SRI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) on our assets, but [a bug in Firefox versions < 52](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1269241) means it calculates the hash incorrectly when the CSS asset has a [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8) and refuses to load the asset.  The BOM is [generated by SASS versions > 3.4](https://github.com/sass/sass/blob/3.4.0/lib/sass/tree/visitors/to_css.rb#L131-L140) and in the versions of rails, sass, sprockets, sass-rails, and sprockets-rails we use it is impossible to configure SASS to stop doing this (as mentioned [in the sass-rails readme](https://github.com/rails/sass-rails/blob/v4.0.0/README.md#configuration) from version 4.0+).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'asset-bom-removal-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install asset_bom_removal-rails

## Usage

The gem hooks itself into the rails `assets:precompile` rake task so you do not need to do anything to use it.  It will run immediately after assets have been precompiled and will fix any CSS files it finds in the precompiled asset root.

It should only affect production environments because sass is (by default) only configured to use `:compressed` style (and thus generate BOMs) in production mode.  In development it uses `:expanded` which does not trigger the BOM insertion.

If you want to run the task yourself run:

    $ bundle exec rake assets:bom-removal

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.
